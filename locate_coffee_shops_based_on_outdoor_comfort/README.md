### Description 
This example shows the solution for finding the most comfortable outdoor places for coffee shops in west village New York. Using [@it]( http://www.food4rhino.com/project/open-data-gis-osm?ufh) it was possible to create the geometries and find the walkways which it is allowed to use outdoor seats. [Ladybug](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug) comfort tools are used to calculate outdoor comfort for each segment of the walkway. The result is calculated based on the assumption that appropriate shading will be designed to protect the users from the heat stress.

Open data that are used in example are:
1. [New York Sidewalk Cafes](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwnsidewalk.shtml)
2. [Sidewalk Cafe Regulations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Sidewalk-Caf-Regulations-GIS-Shapefile/qsuf-mgjh)
