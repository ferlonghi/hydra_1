### Description 
This example shows how to use Ladybug's sunpath and sunlightHours analysis to identify which part of the buildings around Central Park needs to be removed so the park can see more than 4 hours of sunlight on Dec. 21st. Building geometries are generated using @it pluging for Grasshopper.
