### Description 
This file shows how to prepare the geometries surface by surface instead of using Honeybee's automated processes.
I tried to use all the 3 options for different surfaces in a single example. You can use just one of them for all the surfaces if it fits your problem.

I put this file together to answer [this grasshopper discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/xn/detail/2985220:Comment:1375641).
