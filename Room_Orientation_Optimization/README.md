### Description 
This is a simple example to show how the orientation of a room can be optimized for minimum radiation during the summer and maximum radiation during winter.
This example is using Galapagos as an example but for more advanced studies it's better to use multiple objective algorithms such as Octopus. [Here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c32kZN19FU) is a video that shows a similar example solved with Ladybug and Octopus.
