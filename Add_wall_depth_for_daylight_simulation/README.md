### Description 
This file shows how to automate the process of assigning wall thickness to glazing surfaces for daylight simulation.

This file is a modified version of [this Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&fork=hydra_1&id=Honeybee_Grid-based_Daylight_Simulation_Example) and is prepared to answer [this grasshopper discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/discussion-accuracy-of-daylight-simulations-with-no-wall).
